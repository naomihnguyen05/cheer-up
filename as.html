    Artist Statement
</h1>
<p>
    There are many days in the year when we often feel down and under the weather. 
    With this project, I wanted to create a site with a few positive affirmations
    for those individuals. I also wanted to highlight my illustrations and create an
    interactive site. I was very interested in the idea of creating a parallax.
    Instead of creating a scrolling one, I decided on studying the idea of a 3D hover
    parallax. You can experience the hover effect by hovering your cursor over the
    cards and quotes. I hope that those that visit this site, enjoys their experience
    and feel better about their day!
